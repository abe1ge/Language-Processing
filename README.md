# Language-Processing
Language Processing using Lkit developed by S.Lynch

# Language Processing
The requirement for this work is to produce a technical paper explaining how some
aspect of semantically-based language processing can be achieved in the context of a
system which aims to infer appropriate meanings for non-trivial sentence (see example
sentence series below). Note that your paper should explain how your work fits in to a
wider context of language processing.

# work must contain

Any work must include an element of software development either (i) in Clojure (ii) in
Lisp, or (iii) using LKit.
Examples of acceptable work include...

1. writing a lexicon and grammar for LKit to process sentences like those below;
2. software to perform event sequence analysis;
3. software to fit case frames into primitive verbs and perform appropriate inference;
4. writing a parser capable of accepting non-trivial language rules.
